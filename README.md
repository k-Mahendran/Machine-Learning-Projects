# üß† Machine Learning Projects by k-Mahendran

This repository contains a collection of Machine Learning projects implemented using various classification algorithms and datasets. The primary goal of these projects is to apply preprocessing, perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and use appropriate machine learning models to solve real-world classification problems.
